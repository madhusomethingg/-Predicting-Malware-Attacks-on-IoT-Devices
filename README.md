# Project Name: Predicting Malware Attacks on IoT Devices

In this project, we delved into the realm of predicting malware attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices using machine learning techniques. Our analysis centered around a dataset comprising nine diverse devices sourced from UCI. Through rigorous examination, we identified XGBoost as the most effective model, showcasing superior accuracy in predicting malware attacks. The research culminated in the proposal of an improved methodology aimed at elevating both speed and accuracy in the detection and prevention of malware incidents, thus making a meaningful contribution to the enhancement of IoT security. Impressively, the research achieved an accuracy rate of 97%, underscoring the robustness of the proposed approach. Beyond its technical achievements, this work holds substantial implications for advancing safety and privacy within the IoT landscape, addressing critical cybersecurity concerns in the interconnected world of devices.
